# bustle
a re-creation of _BUSTLE: Botton-up Program Synthesis Through Learning-Guided Exploration_, an [ICLR 2021 paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=yHeg4PbFHh) by Odena et al.

## TODOs

- [x] implement basic bottom-up synthesis (Algorithm 1 without blue lines)
- [x] test implementation on tiny arithmetic language
- [ ] allow multiple DSLs
- [ ] implement string manipulation DSL (Figure 1)
- [ ] implement ML add-ons (Algorithm 1 including blue lines)
- [ ] use the benchmarks mentioned in the paper
  - [ ] Appendix B
  - [ ] SysGus
- [ ] generate data from synthesis search (last paragraph of Section 3.1)
